 * this class defines API SDK exports, API is exported as protocol as RoboVM creates objc classes during runtime

 * things to consider:
 *   1. all interfaces shall extend ObjCProtocol
 *   2. all methods shall be annotated with @Mehthod otherwise they will not be registered as part of objc class
 *   3. if method has to return object from this api -- return protocol version of it
 *   4. it will be not possible to instantiate SDK classes with [[cls alloc] init] as there is no classe exposes
 *      compilation type to create new instance provide such api in SDK
